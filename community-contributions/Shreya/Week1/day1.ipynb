      "Full Text: EC2 WordPress Migration Guide\n",
      "machmacurry.com\n",
      "This document describes, in detail, the complete end-to-end process followed to migrate the\n",
      "WordPress website machmacurry.com from AWS Account A (EC2-A) to AWS Account B\n",
      "(EC2-B). It includes the reasoning behind each step, common issues encountered, and the clean\n",
      "best-practice approach used to bring the site live successfully.\n",
      "1. Migration Objective\n",
      "The primary goal was to decommission AWS Account A completely while preserving the WordPress\n",
      "website, database, media, themes, plugins, and domain configuration. The website had to be fully\n",
      "operational in AWS Account B with HTTPS enabled and DNS correctly configured.\n",
      "2. Source Environment (Account A)\n",
      "- EC2 instance running Ubuntu with Nginx and WordPress (Bitnami-based structure).\n",
      "- Domain managed via Route 53 in Account A.\n",
      "- SSL managed using Let’s Encrypt (Certbot).\n",
      "- WordPress database hosted locally (MySQL/MariaDB).\n",
      "3. Target Environment (Account B)\n",
      "- New AWS Account B.\n",
      "- Fresh EC2 instance (Ubuntu 22.04).\n",
      "- WordPress deployed manually (non-Bitnami).\n",
      "- DNS to be managed independently (Route 53 optional).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Data Backup from EC2-A\n",
      "Why: A complete backup ensures that no content is lost during migration.\n",
      "Actions:\n",
      "1. Database backup using mysqldump.\n",
      "2. WordPress files backup including wp-content, themes, plugins, and uploads.\n",
      "3. Verified backup integrity before transfer.\n",
      "5. File Transfer to Local Machine\n",
      "Why: Local storage provides a safe intermediate checkpoint before restoring to EC2-B.\n",
      "Actions:\n",
      "- Used SCP/PSCP to download database dump and WordPress tar archive from EC2-A.\n",
      "- Validated file sizes and permissions locally.\n",
      "6. EC2-B Instance Setup\n",
      "Why: A clean environment avoids configuration conflicts from legacy setups.\n",
      "Actions:\n",
      "- Launched new EC2 instance using correct key pair.\n",
      "- Installed Nginx, PHP, MySQL/MariaDB, and required PHP extensions.\n",
      "- Configured security groups for SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Restoring WordPress Files\n",
      "Why: WordPress content, themes, and plugins reside in the filesystem.\n",
      "Actions:\n",
      "- Extracted wp-content into /var/www/wordpress.\n",
      "- Fixed symbolic links created earlier by Bitnami paths.\n",
      "- Corrected ownership to www-data:www-data.\n",
      "8. Restoring Database\n",
      "Why: WordPress settings, pages, users, and configuration are database-driven.\n",
      "Actions:\n",
      "- Created WordPress database and user.\n",
      "- Imported SQL dump into MySQL.\n",
      "- Verified tables and row counts.\n",
      "9. wp-config.php Configuration\n",
      "Why: WordPress must connect to the correct database and environment.\n",
      "Actions:\n",
      "- Updated DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_HOST.\n",
      "- Ensured correct table prefix.\n",
      "- Fixed broken symlinks and ensured correct file location.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Fixing wp-admin and Login Issues\n",
      "Issues Observed:\n",
      "- wp-login.php working but wp-admin returning 404.\n",
      "- Incorrect redirects to localhost or old IP.\n",
      "Fix:\n",
      "- Corrected Nginx root and WordPress siteurl/home values.\n",
      "- Replaced old IP addresses in database.\n",
      "11. DNS & Domain Migration\n",
      "Why: Domain must point to Account B after Account A deletion.\n",
      "Actions:\n",
      "- Updated GoDaddy nameservers (if using Route 53) or A records directly.\n",
      "- Pointed machmacurry.com and www.machmacurry.com to new EC2 Elastic IP.\n",
      "12. SSL (HTTPS) Setup\n",
      "Why: HTTPS is mandatory for security, SEO, and browser trust.\n",
      "Actions:\n",
      "- Installed Certbot.\n",
      "- Fixed Nginx server_name configuration.\n",
      "- Issued Let’s Encrypt certificate successfully.\n",
      "- Enabled automatic renewal.\n",
      "\n",
      "13. Final Validation\n",
      "- Homepage loads correctly.\n",
      "- wp-admin and wp-login work.\n",
      "- Plugins and themes load without errors.\n",
      "- HTTPS lock verified.\n",
      "- No references to old EC2 or Account A remain.\n",
      "14. Safe Decommissioning of Account A\n",
      "Why: Avoid unnecessary cost and security risk.\n",
      "Actions:\n",
      "- Verified site stability on Account B.\n",
      "- Terminated EC2-A.\n",
      "- Deleted Route 53 hosted zone from Account A.\n",
      "- Closed Account A safely.\n",
      "Result:\n",
      "machmacurry.com is now fully operational in AWS Account B with a clean, secure, and maintainable\n",
      "architecture.\n",
